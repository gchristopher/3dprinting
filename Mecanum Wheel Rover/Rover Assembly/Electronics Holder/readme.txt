This is a printable "proto-board" concept for holding and wiring carrier boards. The board is a frame designed to hold female header strips at 0.1" DIP package spacing to provide a socket frame for electronics carried boards. The female headers can be glued to the printed frame and then wired similarly to how one might wire sockets soldered into a proto board. 

A model for a snap-on cover is included. (Two pieces)

The electronics consist of a LPCXpresso board with an LPC1769 (Strictly because I wanted to play with ARM, the processing power isn't needed), two Pololu TB6612FNG dual motor drivers, a Pololu D24V10F5 5V regulator, and an Adafruit BlueSmirf Bluetooth serial module.
