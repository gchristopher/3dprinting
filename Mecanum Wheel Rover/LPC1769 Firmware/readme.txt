Goes here: LPC1769 firmware for a mecanum wheel rover. 

Apologies for the absent firmware! It should be up soon. 

I'm still working on a refactor as well as figuring out the best way to redistribute LPCOpen-based code. 

I don't think there's any license issues there, but I need to carefully read through it all first. 

Also, the vast majority of hobbyists will be more interested in an arduino-based solution, which I haven't put together yet.
