This is a simple program to control a Mecanum rover using a USB gamepad and a serial port. 

This software requires Boost and SDL2. A sample project for VS2012 is provided, but really, getting the library requirements together is a lot harder than building a small project like this one. 

The asynchronous serial wrapper for Boost::asio is from Terraneo Federico's very nice collection of Boost serial examples. (Thanks!)
