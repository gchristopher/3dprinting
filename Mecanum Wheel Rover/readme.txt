This is a small sample rover using Mecanum wheels generated with a Parametric Mecanum Wheel generator tool. The goal was to have the mechanical components be 100% from-scratch as a design and learning exercise.

It works pretty well on carpet, but printed from hard plastic, doesn't have enough weight and friction to drive sideways reliably on hard surfaces. The itty-bitty wheel bearings collect hair like crazy.
