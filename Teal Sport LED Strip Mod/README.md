# LED Persistence of Vision Display for Teal Sport Drone

This is the repository for a project to add a POV display to a Teal Sport Drone.

The full writeup, associated circuit design, and preliminary test photo/video
can be found at the [project page on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2640187).

(Yes, I finally got sucked into one of their contests, but it's been fun.)
