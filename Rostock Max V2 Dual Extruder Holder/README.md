This is a printed dual extruder holder design for the SeeMeCNC Rostock Max V2 delta 3D printer. It holds two SeeMeCNC EzStruder direct drive bowden tube extruders.

It reroutes both filament paths through the center hole, with an integrated wire guide to bring all the wiring out behind the holder assembly.

It uses existing top plate holes that would normally be used for extruder holders and angles both bowden tubes away from the towers to avoid catching the tubes on the carriages. The extruders are offset so that the two paths followed by the filament are symmetric.

These files contain optional settings, such as manual rafts and anchors to help print successfully.
